# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal static website project consisting of a single HTML file. The project is extremely simple with no build process, package management, or complex architecture.

## Project Structure

```
oz-landing/
└── index.html    # Main HTML file (contains minimal content)
```

## Development

This is a static HTML project with no dependencies or build process:

- **No package.json** - No npm/yarn dependencies
- **No build process** - Direct HTML editing
- **No tests** - Static HTML only
- **No linting** - No JavaScript or CSS files present

To work with this project:
1. Edit `index.html` directly
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to preview changes

## Current State

The index.html file currently contains:
- Basic HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration
- A Korean comment: "팀장이 수정함" (Team leader modified)
- No actual HTML structure or content yet

## Notes

This appears to be a landing page project in its very early stages. Future development will likely involve:
- Adding proper HTML structure (head, body sections)
- Including CSS for styling
- Potentially adding JavaScript for interactivity
- Setting up a proper development workflow if the project grows
